git:
  # Travis CI clones repositories to a depth of 50 commits, which is only
  # really useful if you are performing git operations.
  # We restrict to just top level commit, because we are not interested in git
  # operations and fetching the history could be quite large.
  # Please note that if you use a depth of 1 and have a queue of jobs, Travis
  # CI won’t build commits that are in the queue when you push a new commit.
  depth: 1

  # Don't clone the `examples/` submodule:
