  \ttitemn{2016-Apr-22} version 5.02.10, r5833\\
  the function \hyperref[subsubsec:table]{TABINDEX} has been introduced and the section has been reschuffled.

%  \ttitemn{2016-Apr-19} version 5.02.10, r5816, r5817\\
%  the intialization of modules twiss, track, emit, touschek, dynap, plot, ibs has been reviewed with the introduction of the new fix point search for proper beam initialization. This affected the physics in the presence of RF with HARMON attributes or changes in deltap.

  \ttitemn{2016-Apr-19} version 5.02.10, r5816\\
  the defaults for \hyperref[sec:beam]{\texttt{BEAM}} attributes \texttt{ET, SIGT, SIGE} have been set to the values $10^{-3}, 1, 10^{-3}$ respectively (were $1, 0, 0$).

  \ttitemn{2016-Apr-07} version 5.02.10, r5810\\
  the attribute \hyperref[chap:twiss]{SECTORACC} has been added to the twiss command for sectormap computation.

  \ttitemn{2016-Feb-14} version 5.02.08, r5673\\
  fixed a bug in \hyperref[chap:emit]{\texttt{EMIT}} whereby the
  coordinates of the orbit were mixed up (through Fortran equivalence
  statements) between the vertical and longitudinal plane, leading to
  wrong results in damping partition numbers and emittances. In all tests
  in our test-suite the difference turned out to be very small but other
  users might experience otherwise.

  \ttitemn{2015-Nov-03} version 5.02.07, r5484\\
  the \hyperref[subsec:keyword]{keyword \texttt{VERSION}} has been introduced.
  
  \ttitemn{2015-Sep-15} version 5.02.07, r5407\\
  Removed the precedence information in the \hyperref[sec:beam]{\texttt{BEAM}} 
  command between the longitudinal emittance (\texttt{ET}) and beams sizes 
  (\texttt{SIGT} and \texttt{SIGE}) since this is actually not implemented in the 
  code.
  
  \ttitemn{2015-Sep-15} version 5.02.07, r5399\\
  A new option \texttt{NOEXPR} has been added to the
  \hyperref[sec:save]{\texttt{SAVE}} command to allow saving sequences
  with only values and no expressions in variables and commands.
  
  \ttitemn{2015-Sep-04} version 5.02.07, r5380\\
  Change of the trailing message printed on output that no longer 
  mentions the version number and version architecture. 
  The same information can already be found in the header message.

  \ttitemn{2015-Aug-31} version 5.02.07, r5367\\
  \texttt{TEAPOT} is now the default style for 
  \hyperref[chap:makethin]{\texttt{MAKETHIN}}. 
  The previous default style that was used when the \texttt{STYLE} 
  attribute was not specified in the \texttt{MAKETHIN} command 
  has been given the name \texttt{HYBRID} 
  and can still be used with the explicit \texttt{STYLE=hybrid} attribute. \\
  \textbf{All \texttt{MAKETHIN} commands where \texttt{STYLE} is not specified now
  use the \texttt{TEAPOT} style instead of the previously unnamed \texttt{HYBRID} 
  style}

  \ttitemn{2015-Jul-15} version 5.02.06, r5336 \\
  corrected a typo in equation \ref{eq:field-components} 
  reported by Michael Severance (Stony Brook). 
  The $B_2$ factor of the expansion of the $B_x$ 
  field was reading $(xy - \frac{h^3}{6}y^3+\cdots)$ 
  and has been corrected to $(xy - \frac{h}{6}y^3+\cdots)$.

  \ttitemn{2015-Jun-09} version 5.02.06, r5250\\
  added a guard against negative sequence length and negative 
  element lengths at the time of sequence expansion triggered 
  by a \hyperref[sec:use]{\texttt{USE}} command, with \madx then 
  finishing with fatal error. No checks were performed so far 
  on these attributes, assuming that all length were positive.

  \ttitemn{2015-Jun-05} version 5.02.06, r5247\\
  added the cardinal sine \texttt{SINC(x)} to the list of 
  \hyperref[subsec:operator]{available operators in arithmetic 
  expressions}.

  \ttitemn{2015-Mar-31} version 5.02.05, r5181\\
  added a \hyperref[sec:shrink]{\texttt{SHRINK}} command to remove 
  rows at the end of an existing table.

  \ttitemn{2015-Mar-11} version 5.02.05, r5162\\
  \textbf{Major change} to the definition of emittances in the 
  \hyperref[chap:beam]{\texttt{BEAM}} command. For historical reasons, 
  there was a factor 4 in the relation between normalised emittance 
  $\epsilon_n$ and geometric emittance $\epsilon$: 
  $\epsilon_n = 4 \beta \gamma \ \epsilon$, where $\beta$ and 
  $\gamma$ are the usual relativistic factors. \\
  The common definition $\epsilon_n = \beta \gamma \ \epsilon$ 
  is now used across all \madx modules.
  
  The \hyperref[sec:aperture]{\texttt{APERTURE}} command now gets the 
  geometric emittances from values input or calculated in the 
  \hyperref[chap:beam]{\texttt{BEAM}} command; the attributes
  \texttt{EXN} and \texttt{EYN} of the \texttt{APERTURE} command have
  been removed together with their default value of \texttt{EXN =
    2.75E-6} and \texttt{EYN = 2.75E-6} corresponding to the standard
  normalized emittances for LHC beams in collisions. 
  

  \ttitemn{2015-Mar-10} version 5.02.05, r5161\\
  \textbf{Major change} to definition of \texttt{RACETRACK} 
  \hyperref[sec:def-aper]{aperture type}. 
  The \texttt{RACETRACK} aperture now refers to a generalized shape 
  with rounding of corner with ellipse instead of circle. 
  The \texttt{APERTURE} array now takes four arguments for the 
  \texttt{RACETRACK} shape: maximum horizontal extent, maximum 
  vertical extent, horizontal semi-axis and vertical semi-axis 
  of ellipse for rounding the corner. \\
  \textbf{Note also that the definition of the first two arguments 
  has changed from horizontal and vertical offsets to horizontal 
  and vertical maximum extensions.}

  Removed also all references in the code and the manual to the 
  \texttt{MARGUERITE} aperture type (two \texttt{RECTCIRCLE}s 
  crossing at right angle) that has been deprecated for some 
  time already.

%%  \ttitemn{2015-Mar-06} version 5.02.05, r5158\\
%  \textbf{Major change} to collimator elements: the \texttt{RCOLLIMATOR} 
%  and \texttt{ECOLLIMATOR} elements are no longer defined in \madx and 
%  replaced by a generic \hyperref[sec:collimator]{\texttt{COLLIMATOR}} element.\\
%  \textbf{(give reference to web page giving details for translation...)}

  \ttitemn{2015-Feb-19} version 5.02.05, r5143\\
  added the \texttt{OCTAGON} in the list of predefined 
  \hyperref[chap:aperture]{\texttt{APERTURE}} types.
  
  \ttitemn{2015-Feb-11} version 5.02.05, r5128\\
  clarified that the \texttt{NMASS} constant is the unified atomic mass 
  unit and not the neutron mass. None of the constants have changed in 2014 PDG 
  publication with respect to the 2012 version \cite{PDG2012}. Updated
  the reference to PDG publications to include 2014 version \cite{PDG2014}.

  \ttitemn{2015-Jan-28} version 5.02.05, r5118\\
  clarified in the \hyperref[chap:elements]{definition of magnetic elements} 
  that the effect of defined magnetic strengths is always the same, 
  irrespective of the \hyperref[sec:beam]{\texttt{CHARGE}} of the particles declared 
  in the \hyperref[sec:beam]{\texttt{BEAM}} command. It is agreed in the literature 
  that a positive quadrupole (positive $K_1$) focuses positive particles in the 
  horizontal plane and defocuses negative particles in the same horizontal 
  plane, for the same direction of propagation. \\ 
  Currently \mad ignores the \hyperref[sec:beam]{\texttt{CHARGE}} attribute and 
  focuses both positive and negative particles in the horizontal plane when 
  going through a quadrupole with positive $K_1$. \\
  \textbf{THIS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE TO CONFORM TO EXISTING CONVENTIONS}\\
  Electrostatic elements (\hyperref[sec:elseparator]{\texttt{ELSEPARATOR}}, 
  \hyperref[sec:rfcavity]{\texttt{RFCAVITY}},
  \hyperref[sec:crabcavity]{\texttt{CRABCAVITY}}, and the RF part of the
  \hyperref[sec:rfmultipole]{\texttt{RFMULTIPOLE}}) handle the
  \hyperref[sec:beam]{\texttt{CHARGE}} attribute appropriately and provide 
  opposite effects for opposite charges travelling in the same direction. 


  \ttitemn{2014-Dec-19} version 5.02.05, r5111\\
  added the Gauss error function \texttt{ERF} and the complementary error function 
  \texttt{ERFC} to the list of \hyperref[subsec:operator]{available operators in 
  arithmetic expressions}. Added documentation in the same section for the 
  \texttt{FLOOR}, \texttt{CEIL} and \texttt{ROUND} functions that were already 
  implemented. 
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Dec-10} version 5.02.04, r5093 and r5101\\
  clarified the global coordinate system figure~\ref{F-GLOB} with colors and 
  representations of projections of planes onto the horizontal Cartesian 
  plane as well as intersections of local coordinate planes with horizontal 
  Cartesian plane. 
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Nov-25} version 5.02.04, r5092\\
  removed the \hyperref[sec:global]{\texttt{GLOBAL}} matching constraints
  \texttt{DDQ1, DDQ2} from the documentation since they are not
  implemented in the code.  
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Nov-14} version 5.02.04, r5081\\
  added a \hyperref[sec:copyfile]{\texttt{COPYFILE}} command. Changed the attribute 
  name for the destination for the \hyperref[sec:renamefile]{\texttt{RENAMEFILE}} 
  command from \texttt{NAME} to \texttt{TO}.
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Nov-13} version 5.02.04, r5078\\
  fixed figure \ref{F-YSDISP} where the \textit{x}-axis was pointing in
  the wrong direction and the orientation of the element for positive
  \texttt{DPHI} was also not conforming to the text for the
  \hyperref[sec:ealign]{\texttt{EALIGN}} command.
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Nov-13}  version 5.02.04, r5080\\
  documented a bug occurring when \hyperref[sec:beamline]{\texttt{LINE}}
  or \hyperref[sec:macro]{\texttt{MACRO}} constructs appear within a
  \hyperref[sec:if]{\texttt{IF ... ELSEIF ... ELSE}} or a 
  \hyperref[sec:while]{\texttt{WHILE}} construct. This bug will not be
  fixed now. \\  
  Clarified also that \texttt{IF ... ELSEIF ... ELSE} and \texttt{WHILE}
  constructs can be nested to at least six levels deep.
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Oct-14} version 5.02.03, r5013\\
  fixed a documented feature of \hyperref[chap:survey]{\texttt{SURVEY}}
  where the first \texttt{KSL} component of thin
  \hyperref[sec:multipole]{\texttt{MULTIPOLE}} elements, representing a
  vertical angle for a thin dipole, was not taken into account. Both
  \texttt{KNL} and \texttt{KSL} are now properly taken into
  account. Another change was to make \texttt{SURVEY} take into account
  the \hyperref[sec:rfmultipole]{\texttt{RFMULTIPOLE}} elements in the
  same way that it treats \texttt{MULTIPOLE} elements.
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Aug-27} version 5.02.03, r4947 \\
  changed the behaviour of \hyperref[sec:fill]{\texttt{FILL}} to accept as
  parameter a row number equal to the current number of rows in the
  table plus one, with the effect of creating a new row and filling it. 
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Aug-25} version 5.02.03, r4942 and r4943\\
  harmonized the behaviour of \hyperref[sec:fill]{\texttt{FILL}},
  \hyperref[sec:setvars]{\texttt{SETVARS}} and
  \hyperref[sec:setvars-lin]{\texttt{SETVARS\_LIN}} with respect to
  negative row numbers, and updated the default values. Added
  documentation sections for \texttt{SETVARS} and \texttt{SETVARS\_LIN}
  that were hitherto undocumented.   
  
  
  \ttitemn{2014-Aug-18} version 5.02.03, r4932 \\
  a single element can now be repeated in a beamline expansion:
  \texttt{2*S} and \texttt{-2*S} are of course identical (single
  elements are not reversed head to tail), and also equivalent to
  \texttt{2*(S)} and \texttt{-2*(S)} if \texttt{S} is a single
  element.\\
  Documentation updated; see \ref{sec:reflect-repeat-lines}
