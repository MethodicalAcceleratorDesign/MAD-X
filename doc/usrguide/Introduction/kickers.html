<h2>Closed Orbit Correctors</h2>
</center>

Three types of closed orbit correctors are available:
<ul>
<li><a name=hkick>HKICKER</a>,
a corrector for the horizontal plane,
<li><a name=vkick>VKICKER</a>,
a corrector for the vertical plane,
<li><a name=kick>KICKER</a>,
a corrector for both planes.
</ul>
<pre>
label:   HKICKER, L=real,KICK=real,TILT=real;
label:   VKICKER, L=real,KICK=real,TILT=real;
label:   KICKER,  L=real,HKICK=real,VKICK=real,TILT=real;
</pre>
The type KICKER should not be used when an orbit corrector kicks only
in one plane.
<br>
<br>
The attributes have the following meaning:
<ul>
<li>L:
  The length of the closed orbit corrector (default: 0 m).
<li>KICK: 
  The momentum change 
  delta(PX)=delta(<i>p<sub>x</sub></i>)/<i>p<sub>0</sub></i> 
  or delta(PY)=delta(<i>p<sub>y</sub></i>)/<i>p<sub>0</sub></i>
  for respectively horizontal or vertical correctors. (default: 0).
<li>HKICK: 
  The horizontal momentum change 
  delta(PX)=delta(<i>p<sub>x</sub></i>)/<i>p<sub>0</sub></i> 
  for a corrector acting in both planes (default: 0). 
<li>VKICK: 
  The vertical momentum change 
  delta(PY)=delta(<i>p<sub>y</sub></i>)/<i>p<sub>0</sub></i> 
  for a corrector acting in both planes (default: 0).
<LI>TILT:
  The roll angle about the longitudinal axis (default: 0 rad). A
  positive angle represents a clockwise rotation of the kicker.
</ul>
A positive kick increases <i>p<sub>x</sub></i> or <i>p<sub>y</sub></i>
respectively. This means that a positive horizontal kick bends to the left, 
i.e. to positive x which is opposite of what is true for bends. 
<br>
The deviation angle (theta) of the particle trajectory is related to the momentum change through 
sin(theta) = delta(P)=delta(<i>p</i>)/<i>p<sub>0</sub></i>.
<br>
It should be noted that the kick values values assigned to an orbit corrector
like above are not overwritten by an orbit correction using the CORRECT command.
Instead the kicks computed by an orbit correction and the assigned
values are added when the correctors are used.
<p>
Examples:
<pre>
HK1:   HKICKER, KICK=0.001;
VK3:   VKICKER, KICK=0.0005;
VK4:   VKICKER, KICK:=AVK4;
KHV1:  KICKER,  HKICK=0.001,VKICK=0.0005;
KHV2:  KICKER,  HKICK:=AKHV2H,VKICK:=AKHV2V;
</pre>
The assignment in the form of a deferred expression has the advantage
that the values can be assigned and/or modified at any time (and matched !).
<BR>
The <a href="local_system.html#straight">straight reference system</a>
for an orbit corrector is a Cartesian coordinate system.

<p>
<font color=ff0000> Please note that there is a new feature introduced
by Stefan Sorge from GSI. Here his decription:</font>

<p>The elements KICKER, HKICKER, and VKICKER can also be used as 
an exciter providing a sinusoidal momentum kick. The usage in this case is 
<p>
<p>xykick: KICKER, SINKICK=integer, SINPEAK=real, SINTUNE=real, SINPHASE=real; 
<p>xkick : HKICKER, SINKICK=integer, SINPEAK=real, SINTUNE=real, SINPHASE=real; 
<p>ykick : VKICKER, SINKICK=integer, SINPEAK=real, SINTUNE=real, SINPHASE=real; 
<p>
where a sinusoidal momentum kick dpz as a function of the 
revolution number n given by 
<p>
dpz(n)=SINPEAK * sin(2*PI*SINTUNE*n + SINPHASE), pz=px,py 
<p>
is provided. So, the variables are
<p>
<p>SINKICK - integer, must be set to 1 to switch on the sinusoidal signal, 
      default: 0. 
<p>SINPEAK - amplitude of the bending angle (rad), default: 0 rad. 
<p>SINTUNE - frequency of the signal times the revolution frequency. 
      Hence, the phase per revolution is 2*PI*SINTUNE, default: 0. 
<p>SINPHASE - initial phase, default: 0 rad. 
<p>
KICKER generates a kick in horizontal and a kick vertical direction, 
where both are synchron, HKICKER generates a horizontal kick, 
and VKICKER generates a vertical kick. 
<p>
The momentum kick of a kicker has only a single frequency. An element 
having a finite bandwidth can approximately created by defining 
thin kickers with all amplitudes SINPEAK, frequencies SINTUNE, and 
initial phases SINPHASE desired and putting them at the same position s in 
the accelerator.
