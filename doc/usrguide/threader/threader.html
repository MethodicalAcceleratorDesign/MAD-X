In a machine with magnetic and alignment errors it can happen that the beam 
does not circulate and the closed orbit cannot be established and measured. 
This can also happen in MAD-X and the closed orbit finder does not converge.
<p>
The <b>threader</b> simulates beam steering through such a machine with repeated 
measurement of trajectory over a certain number of monitors and correction of the 
trajectory with upstream correctors.  
<p>
When enabled, threading is executed whenever a trajectory or closed orbit search is
carried out by the <A HREF="../twiss/twiss.html">TWISS</A> module.
<p>

The threader is controlled as an option. 
The following MAD-X commands enables the threader :
<p><pre>
<b>option, threader ;</b>
</pre>
and the threader can be disabled with
<p><pre>
<b>option, -threader ;</b>
</pre>

<p>
During the trajectory search in Twiss, or the first turn of the orbit search for a closed machine, 
the threader calculates at each monitor the difference between the present trajectory reading and a reference value. 
If the difference exceeds a threshold (see below), the threader searches backwards for the first corrector that 
will efficiently cancel the difference and calculates the corresponding kick. The trajectory is then recalculated 
starting again from that corrector and progressing forward. The calculated kicks are added to already existing kicks. 
If Twiss is searching for a closed orbit which involves tracking this trajectory over many turns, the threader is 
only active during the first turn. 
<p>
The reference value for the trajectory difference is zero by default but can also be obtained from a previous orbit 
calculation if the current <b>Twiss</b> command has the <b>useorbit</b> flag enabled and a previous <b>Twiss</b> 
command had the <b>keeporbit</b> flag enabled. 
<p>
The threshold values for triggering the threader correction can be set with the command 
<p><pre>
<b>threader, vector = {xmax, ymax, att} ;</b>
</pre>
where <pre>
xmax, ymax : threshold orbit excursions beyond which the threader is applied.
att        : attenuation factor for the kicks applied by the threader
defaults   : {0.005, 0.005, 1.000}
</pre>
The attenuation factor defines the fraction of the calculated kick that is actually applied by the threader. 
An attenuation factor of 0.5 will apply 50% of the calculated kicks.
