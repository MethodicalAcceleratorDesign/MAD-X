 *

 * PS BOOSTER. Directory: /afs/cern.ch/eng/ps/cps/Psb

 * It consists of 16 identical periods, apart from the equipment

 * in the straight sections.

 * The BOOSTER has a radius of 25m and thus a circonference of 157.08m

 *

 * The injected beam from the linac have Ekin=50 MeV proton beam with p~300MeV/c.

 * (311 MeV/c according to the report: http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/p05/PAPERS/TPAT054.PDF)

 * corresponding to E=0.988471 GeV and E0=0.938272 GeV. (The rest mass of a proton is 0.938272 GeV)

 *

 * The kinetic energy of the extracted beam is Ekin=1.4 GeV and p=2.141766 GeV/c [p=(SQRT(Ekin^2+2*E0*Ekin)/c]

 * The beam is extracted to the PS. In the PS, it is injected in SS42.

 *

 *

 * Revolution time at extraction:  T,revolution,ext = 572.79 ns (nano  seconds)

 * Revolution time at injection:   T,revolution,inj =   1.6  us (micro seconds)

 * The BOOSTER today has 2 bunches in each ring, i.e. 8 bunches in the PS.

 * Injection time: C=275 ms, measure time C=290 ms

 *

 * Working points:

 * Injection - high intensity          : QX=4.28,  QY=4.55

 * Injection - low  intensity e.g. LHC : QX=4.28,  QY=4.45

 * Extraction                          : QX=4.172, QY=4.23   = wp1

 *

 *

 *

 *

 * The 2 MHz cavities are for the H0 mode, they are run around 8kV.

 * They are run at the revolution frequency.

 * The beam is below transition.

 *

 * The 4 MHz cavities are used to flatten the bunches.

 * They reduce the peak current compared to the average currents.

 * The 4 MHz cavities are run between 6-8 kV.

 * They are run at twice the revolution frequency.

 *

 *

 * All elements in the straight sections added.  21 Dec 2006 O.Berrig

 * New working point: QX = 4.172 and QY = 4.23.  21 Dec 2006 O.Berrig

/*

Christian Carli informed me that the beam scope

is the main aperture limitation in the PS BOOSTER.

The beamscope dipoles (HOR & VER): DBSHVL4 are in P7L4, P8L4 & P9L4.



PSBBCSCR0001  Scraper  https://edms.cern.ch/file/220022/0/psbbcscr0001-v0.plt

The aperture limit in the PSB is the "beamscope window", located in P8L2.

Half_length=50 mm (hor.) and half_length=28.6 mm (vert.).

It's used for transverse emittance measurement via shaving of the beam. M.Benedict

Thickness of the beamscope (WBS) = 40 mm
